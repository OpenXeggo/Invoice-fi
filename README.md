# Xeggo Invoice

## Description
Transparency and automation are much needed in Invoice financing. Invoice financing is a huge market where the digital invoice is generated as of now on the centralised system where trust and authenticity issues are there along with lots of manual work.

One-stop solution Xeggo can quickly solve this. Invoices are digitally generated on a chain, and payments are made on the stable coin.
There are a number of benefits of doing so like:
* Transparency issue resolved when onchain invoices are generated.
* Stablecoin provides more comprehensive and open market participation with a better economic model.
* Automation can be done at max when invoices are generated onchain like partial/stream payment.
* It can be easily used for the next step of invoice factoring
